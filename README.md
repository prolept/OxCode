#### Auto Completion


Autocompletion is provided as you type, after `[.]` (while calling a function ) or `[this.]` (inside a member function).

#### Include Autocomplete

Provide autocompletion when you type an `#include` or `#import` statement. After typing `<` or `"` to begin the file name, the extension will scan your include directories to provide suggestions. 

#### Suggestion for Import/Include

![Import Suggestion](https://www.prolept.com/vscode/importsuggestion.gif)

#### Signature Help 

Signature Help is given after a parenthesis `(`.  If the function declaration is documented with a javadoc comment, then the documentation is displayed. 

#### Linter

A basic linter rule is currently supported : 

- Check for unused local variables.

To run the linter,  right click an ox file, click `Show All Commands` and `OX Lint my code`.

## Tips and Tricks

- If you want to use OxMetrics directly in Excel: see [XlModeler](https://www.timberlake.co.uk/software/xl-modeler.html)

- You can easily exclude *.bak files from the explorer using the following in your user setting: 

```
   "files.exclude": {
         "**/*.bak": true
      }
```

- An alternative way to run/compile ox files is via tasks. See [Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) . 

   Example (windows): 
```
 {
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
    
        {
            "label": "Run ox",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "C:\\PROGRA~1\\OxMetrics8\\ox\\bin64\\oxl.exe",
            "args": [
                "-i${workspaceFolder}",
                "-i${fileDirname}",
                "${file}"
            ],
            "problemMatcher": [],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
